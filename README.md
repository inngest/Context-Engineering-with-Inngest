## Features

- ðŸ”„ **Parallel Context Gathering** - Fetches from multiple sources simultaneously (ArXiv, GitHub, Vector DB, Web Search) while matching rate-limit constraints
- ðŸŽ¯ **Semantic Ranking** - The retrieved context is ranked by relevance using embeddings
- ðŸ§  **Specialized Agents** - The context is provided to different specialized models in parallel with automatic retries powered by durable execution
- âš¡ **Live Updates** - Real-time updates streamed to frontend using Inngest Realtime
  - Step-by-step progress indicators
  - Per-source data fetching results
  - AI response streaming (typewriter effect)
  - Execution metadata (concurrency, throttling, rate limits)
  - Error notifications and completion status

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Orchestration**: Inngest
- **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4
- **Vector DB**: In-memory (demo) / Pinecone (production)
- **UI**: React + Tailwind CSS
- **APIs**: ArXiv, GitHub, Web Search

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Vercel AI Gateway API Key (required)
  - [Signup here for $5 monthly credit](https://vercel.com/ai-gateway)
- GitHub token (optional, for GitHub search)
- SerpAPI key (optional, for web search)
- Pinecone key (optional, for deployment)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository and install dependencies**:

```bash
npm install
```

2. **Set up environment variables**:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` and add your API keys:

```bash
AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY=your_vercel-ai-gateway_api_key_here

# Optional: GITHUB_TOKEN, SERP_API_KEY, etc.
```

3. **Start the Inngest Dev Server** (in a separate terminal):

```bash
npx inngest-cli@latest dev
```

This starts the Inngest Dev Server at `http://localhost:8288` where you can see:

- Real-time function execution
- Step-by-step workflow progress
- Rate limiting in action
- Detailed logs and metrics

4. **Start the Next.js development server**:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. **Open your browser**:

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

### Try Sample Queries

- "What are the latest advances in transformer architectures?"
- "Explain retrieval-augmented generation"
- "How does rate limiting work in distributed systems?"

### Viewing the Workflow

1. Submit a query in the web UI
2. Watch the real-time progress visualization
3. Open the Inngest Dev Server at `http://localhost:8288`
4. Navigate to the "Runs" tab to see detailed execution

## Environment Variables

### Required

- `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` - Vercel AI Gateway API Key

### Optional (for development)

- `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY` - Inngest signing key (production only)
- `INNGEST_EVENT_KEY` - Inngest event key (production only)

### Optional (for full functionality)

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - GitHub personal access token for code search
- `PINECONE_API_KEY` - Pinecone API key for vector search
- `PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT` - Pinecone environment
- `SERP_API_KEY` - SerpAPI key for web search

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Linting

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Deployment

## Setting up Pinecone (optional)

To populate your Pinecone vector database with PDF documents:

1. **Ensure your Pinecone index exists**:

   - Log into [Pinecone Console](https://app.pinecone.io/)
   - Create an index named `test-inngest-context-engineering`
   - Dimension: `1536` (for OpenAI embeddings)
   - Metric: `cosine`

2. **Upload a PDF**:

```bash
npm run upload-pdf path/to/your/document.pdf
```

Or upload multiple PDFs:

```bash
npm run upload-pdf ./documents/\*.pdf
```

The script will:

- Extract text from the PDF
- Split it into ~1000 character chunks
- Generate embeddings using OpenAI
- Upload to your Pinecone index

**Example**:

```bash
npm run upload-pdf ./research-papers/transformer-architecture.pdf
```

### Deploy to Vercel

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import the project in Vercel
3. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy!

### Setup your Inngest production application

1. Sign up at [app.inngest.com](https://app.inngest.com)
2. Create a new app
3. Get your signing key and event key
4. Add them to your environment variables
5. Point your production app to Inngest Cloud
